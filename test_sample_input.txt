Chen_Cheng_DESC: "Graduating from Baoding Military Academy in 1922, Chen Cheng entered Whampoa Military Academy two years later, meeting Chiang Kai-shek for the first time, then Commandant of the Academy. Later on, Chen joined National Revolutionary Army, which he climbed up the rank structure with flying colours. His successes allowed him to be promoted time and time again, eventually becoming the commander of the 18th Army.\n\nAfter the end of the Second Chinese Civil War, Chen Cheng's close ties with Chiang Kai-shek and his influence within the military landed Chen a favourable position as the Overseer of the Dongbei Authority, a department overseeing the reconstruction and development of Northeast China prior to his appointment as Premier of the Executive Yuan.\n\nAs Premier, Chen Cheng stayed as Chiang Kai-shek's capable \"right-hand man\", overseeing many national projects, such as his famous land reforms."
